                <p> While creating my design, my biggest challenge was making all the clips flow smoothly together, as I incorporated self-recorded clips and clips from various authors online. Because I wanted my project to be a narrative, clips being placed intentionally and having smooth connections with each other were crucial to making my vision come alive. </p>

                <p id="caption1"> I started out by inserting the clips that would serve as an introduction: opening a fridge and running sink water. I also used fade-in and fade-out effects to help these audios feel like an introduction.

                <p id="caption2">Then, I started to add clips of various fruits being sliced and eaten. About two-thirds of my desired clips were added at this point. Along the way, I added volume amplification and noise reduction effects and used clipping/cutting to ensure smooth flow.

            <!-- VISUAL ARGUMENT -->
            <div class="psections-b psection-9">
                <h1 id="visual-title"> Visual Argument: "Yakult" </h1>
                <p id="visual-desc"> My visual argument, “YAKULT”, aims to persuade viewers to be willing to try out this Japanese probiotic drink. It serves as an advertisement for the product, which can be posted on social media or printed as a poster to display in various locations. The audience I considered while making this encompassed people in the States who haven’t heard of this drink before, and I imagined them seeing my advertisement online on social media platforms or on a poster in crowded areas.</p>

            <div class="psections-b psection-10">
                <h1 id="take-look"> Take a look: </h1>

            <div class="psections-b psection-11">
                <h1 id="visual-challenges-title"> Challenges: </h1>
                <p> I knew that people, especially when scrolling through social media, have short attention spans and you have to capture their attention right off the bat to have an effective advertisement. This was a challenge I faced while making my argument–how to capture viewers’ attention immediately to ensure that they would take those extra few seconds to look at the entirety of my advertisement, which would lead to them being willing to purchase or try this product. To do this, I first made sure I had appealing colors in my advertisement that would not clash and could contrast each other well. To further ensure that I would catch viewers’ attention quickly, I made sure to use minimal assets apart from the product image and aimed to use simplicity and a lower density of elements rather than having too much going on. In the end, I think my resulting argument fulfills my aspirations from when I started it and successfully solves the challenge I faced of catching attention. Looking at my advertisement, I think that it would be successful in stopping people for a few seconds, enough to fully take in everything shown.</p>

                <p>I added the product image with a splash in the background and mirrored the image of the splash since it was 
                originally flipped horizontally. </p>

                <img src="images/visual-2.png" alt="second image of editing an image in gimp program ">
                <p>I wanted the splash to match the color of the drink, so I used the color temperature tool to adjust the splash image’s shade. Now, the splash is not white and instead is closer to the product’s color.

                <p>I used the paths and text tool to curve the top section of text. First, I typed the text out. Then, I made a path of the curve I 
                    wanted the text to take and right-clicked the layer, selecting “text along path”. I created a 
                    layer on top of that and used “fill path” to create the final curved text. This was a challenge 
                    for me as I’m used to photoshop having its own curve text tool, so it took me a while to figure out 
                    these extra steps I had to take in Gimp to do the same thing. I also aligned the message under the product name to make it aesthetically pleasing and consistent.
