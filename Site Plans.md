For my web portfolio, I plan on doing the first option--making an online portfolio with the intention that employers would look at it. I want to create separate pages in my website--a home page, a projects page that will display all the projects I've done in the class thus far and describing various details about them, and an about me page. I have not thought too much about the design I want to have, but I want my site to be appealing to the eyes, not too chaotic yet not boring, aesthetic, simple, and effective. The audience I'm making this portfolio for would be employers, especially for User Interface/User Experience, and I imagine they would visit my portfolio from me applying to a job at their company.

For me, I'm prioritizing and thinking about the following design considerations: I want to have a good balance between using images and words, and I want to incorporate fun colors that wouldn't take away from the content. I also want my site to be easy to navigate and catch viewers' attention quickly, just as I've been drawn to many other sites that I consider to have good UI/UX and have been inspired by them. I hope that my employers would have a smooth and fun experience scrolling through my projects and other pages. I've coded a bit with HTML/CSS before but not too much, so I'm hoping this will be challenging and fun at the same time.
